# Welcome To Spaceship Battles!

## Project/Gameplay
This personal project is a local two-player game where you can challenge each other for a spaceship battle in outer space. Each player picks a side and uses
the controls specified to control their spaceship. Players try to dodge each other's bullets while trying to hit the other player. The first
player whose health reaches 0 loses.

## Development
This game was built using the Python pygame library. It is a very handy tool to build games such as this, and utilizing most of what the library
offers was greatly interesting. Check out the code to see the details of it!

## Running The Game
To run this game locally, you would need to have Python installed and an IDE that runs it. Just clone the repository locally or download the 
zip file to include all the dependencies (make sure everything stays within one folder when you unzip). Unzip (extract) the file and open the folder
in an IDE. Run ```main.py``` and a window with the game pops up. Enjoy!

## Reflection
This is one of my first personal projects (or at least one of the first finished ones), and I really enjoyed working on it.
Pygame is a great library and I thought it was quite simple to work with. While the graphics generated are not top-notch, the 
assets were easy to utilize, and the key events were very intuitive. Overall, I think pygame is a great tool for developers, and
I will definitely be learning more about it and using it in the future.

I have always loved video games and have wanted to develop one for a long time. I hope you enjoy playing it!
